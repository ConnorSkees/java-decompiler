Java decompiler written in pure Rust with a focus on speed

## Status

The decompilation part of this project is in the proof-of-concept stage. The implementations of both control flow reconstruction and generic reconstruction are nascent and not as robust they would be in a production decompiler.

This project also contains code for parsing `.class`, which is quite robust.
